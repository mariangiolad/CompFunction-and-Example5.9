The Haskell code implements the function g that takes a compliance derivation, three global types G1, G2, G3 and three
participant names ph, pv, pw, and returns the global type for the composition via gateways of the three sessions typable, 
respectively with G1, G2 and G3, where ph, pv, pw are the name of the participants for the processes in the compliance derivation.
Such a function is essentially the one defined in the proof of Theorem 5.8 of
F.Barbanera, M.Dezani-Ciancaglini  Partial Typing for Open Compliance in Multiparty Sessions
where a compliance derivation with gateways is used instead of a compliance derivation, and where the participant names are
left implicit.
In the code also the global types used in Example 5.9 are defined.
